Win32/KeyStates version 0.01
============================

Win32::KeyStates was created out of curiousity.  I was curious how
one would go about polling the state of the "sticky" keys: CapsLock,
NumLock, and ScrollLock.  This module is the result of that curiosity.

Microsoft has defined a set of "virtual" keys that can be polled.
This modules allows you to do that.
